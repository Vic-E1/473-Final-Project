<p>
Hi all, my name is Jesse Manao, and I am the main content creator for travel and national park.
I might be weird to some folks but people who know me know that I love, love, and love (did I say LOVE) to organize travels,
create itineraries, prepare trip budgets, and do hours and days of research on places I've never visited.<br><br>
However, all this happened not too long ago.
Not many people know this, but there was a sudden conversion going from a stay home-gamer-lazy bum me to an outgoing-adventurous-active
me as I graduated from college. Long story short, I graduated with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from college after 10 years.
10 YEARS YOU SAY? Yes, I know, I am a disgrace to my Asian family. Nevertheless, they still love me, and today,
I work in a 9 to 5 job setting in Los Angeles.<br><br>
My love for travel started off as I went on my very first camping trip to a BLM site across Joshua Tree National Park in 2017.
Before this moment, I never really thought of having this steaming passion for traveling, despite visiting numerous countries
together with my family and friends beforehand. To say the least, I was not prepared for anything. I was freezing all night because my
sleeping bag was rated for warm temperature, that is to say my dog decided to pee in my sleeping bag to make it warm, and
I think I also heard some coyotes walking around our tent (probably just Raccoons, but you never know)
and to top all this, nobody told me that I had to hold my poop overnight since there are no restrooms. Definitely a terrible
experience for a first-timer. IT WAS HORRIBLE.<br><br>
Somehow, the experience triggered myself wanting to do more (trust me, not a fetish), to explore more,
curious of what this world has in store for us humans. I became obsessed with sceneries of mountains, deserts, lakes, and of course beaches.
 I became infatuated by sunrises and sunsets. I realized that this world is so enormous, that there is not enough time to live
 worrying about what my next job would be, what political issues are in hand, or wars that are going on out there constantly.
I find it peaceful to enjoy nature, in fact, one of the reasons I created this blog is to promote peace through traveling.
<br><br>
In addition, all of the travels I make whether it's domestic or international, will be shared here. Well, I'll try my best to keep
everything here informative, fun, and easy to read. In the future, my hope is to encourage everyone to step outside, and enjoy the sunshine.
 SO LET'S BUCKLE UP AND TRAVEL!
