<b>Ciumbuleuit</b>, is where we booked our AirBnB for 3 nights. We drove from Tangerang for about 4 hours, stopping at a rest area entering Purwakarta. Nothing special about the drive, however, leaving Bekasi into Purwakarta, you will notice a much greener landscape along the sides of the road. Bandung is ranked third as most populated city in Indonesia after Jakarta and Surabaya. Although it's a big city, staying at Bandung does not feel like living in a typical city that has skyscrapers and large roads. Yes, there are tall buildings here and there, but Bandung somehow managed to still conserve nature within it, hence the wide and huge trees and colorful flowers growing in the city. There are a lot of museums and heritage buildings leaving historical stories that we'd love to visit, but maybe next time. On this trip, we wanted to explore the famous craters located on the outskirts of the city.<br><br>
<b>Waroeng Ethnic</b>, located in Ciumbuleuit, is where we had our first dinner, and was recommended by the AirBnB owner. The restaurant has a beautiful Javanese home setting as soon as you arrive. We sat outside on the terrace overlooking the backyard. When visiting Indonesia, you should always have mosquito repellants handy, you will thank me for it. Anyways, we ordered Bitterballen (potato balls) for appetizer, Nasi Tutuk Kriuk (fried rice with cracker bites) and Ayam Penyet (spicy fried chicken, cooked with east javanese style) for the main course, and Pisang Goreng Keju Susu Coklat (fried banana with sweet toppings) for desert. Usually, when visiting Indonesia, I always try to eat street foods that are super cheap although most likely unhygienic. However, this restaurant is a little more expensive than usual but you will get the best quality you can get around. If you are new to Indonesia and want to avoid upsetting your stomach, this would probably be a good place to go.<br><br>
<b>Tangkuban Perahu</b>, Mount Tangkuban Perahu is located in Lembang, which is about 1-2 hours from Bandung. It is well known for its active craters, but do not worry, the volcano is not active anymore. As you enter the area, you will have to pay for an entrance fee of IDR20,000 for locals and IDR200,000 for foreigners (on the weekends it will be IDR30,000 and IDR300,000 respectively). There is no going around this, however, I do have some tips on how to pay as locals, maybe in my future blogs. After the gate, you will continue to drive up the mountain and park at the top. <br>
As you step out of the car, you will be swarmed with people selling overpriced souvenirs like woodcrafts, t-shirts, or volcanic rocks. You can also find people selling horse rides, street foods such as Jagung Bakar (roasted corn) and Bandrek (Sundanese drink, made of ginger, palm sugar, and cinnamon), or photo sessions. Again, other than the foods, they will sell it for a high price, I would say to start your bargain to "of the price," price is the most you should pay. They also have a visitor center at the end of the road where you can find information about the mount and hear more about the history (trust me, you will want to know the story about how the mountain was formed). <br>
There are 4 main craters that visitors are allowed to see/visit: Ratu Crater, Upas Crater, Baru Crater, and Domas Crater. At the visitor center, they can tell you which crater is available for visit, of course, for an additional fee. At the time, we were only able to see Ratu and do a hike down to Domas. Ratu Crater would be the crater that you see west of the parking lot. Not sure if they let people down the crater, but you can take pictures from above to take a panoramic picture overlooking the crater and the two mountain peaks. Now, to get to Domas crater, it is mandatory to have a tour guide (people with green jackets with name tags) provided by them, which will cost IDR100,000 for local and IDR200,000 for foreigners per group of 6 people.<br><br>
<b>Kawah Domas</b>, or Domas Crater, will require about a 1.2km (0.75mi) downhill hike from the parking lot. Now, if you have a driver, you can tell your driver to pick you up at the lower end of the hike so you don�t have to hike back up. If you do so, from the crater, it will be another 0.9km (0.55mi) combination of uphill and flat surface. As you start the hike, there will be a few more people selling freshly made souvenirs, raincoats, and eggs. Why eggs? They want you to buy eggs so you can try cooking the egg on the boiling hot crater. One suggestion, if you do plan on going down to Domas, it would be better for you to have a poncho ready in case of raining and be sure to buy an egg from a local market to save some money. The pathway down is clearly marked with stepping stones, although, it can get very slippery when raining, so be careful. In about 30-60 mins, you should be down at the crater. Feel free to boil your egg, put your feet in the warm craters, or take pictures of the awesome scenery. Some can also get a Sulfuric Mud Mask massage, which they say, will rejuvenate your skin and make you feel refreshed. Too bad, I did not ask for the price. As mentioned, if you have a driver, you will take a different pathway going back. It should take about 20-35 mins fast walking. At the end of the path, you will see more souvenirs being sold. A few steps toward the exit and your driver should be ready just outside.<br><br>
<b>Gubug Makan Mang Engking</b>, located in Lembang, taking a level down from Waroeng Ethnic, going down from the mountain, we stopped at this unique restaurant where you will eat under a hut on top of a huge koi fish pond. I have been to several other restaurants like this before, so I was excited to try this one out. We ordered two Gourami Fish cooked in two different styles (sweet/sour and charcoal-grilled), Grilled Chicken, Tofu and Tempeh, a bowl of Rice, and Sayur Kangkung (water spinach, very famous in Indonesia). For drinks, we ordered Hot Orange and Coconut Juice and another Bandrek. Disappointingly, the service here was super slow (there was only a few other groups at the time) and they keep on forgetting the orders. Compared to similar restaurants I had in the past, this one is far from living up to it. In general, the fish were poorly cooked, some were still raw, and the drinks were way too sweet. Pricewise, it was quite expensive for the quality of food we got. Not sure if I would recommend their food, but we still had a good time playing with the koi fishes by feeding them and dipping our toes on the water.<br><br>
<b>Pasar Apung or Floating Market</b>, in Lembang, upon arriving, there is an entrance fee of IDR20,000 per person in exchange for a free ice or hot drink, so it is pretty much free. Apparently, other than being a floating market that sells food, there are a lot of activities you can do here such as animal petting, swimming, miniature houses, and arcade games. I did not really do a lot of the activities other than just petting some sheep for free. Other ones will cost you, but it should not be that expensive. Eating a lot before visiting a floating market was a big mistake. Here, they sell a wide variety of food that no two vendors sells the same thing, so you will have a bunch options. To do transactions, you have to buy a coin from the exchange booths available around. Most of the food here cost about IDR20,000 to IDR40,000, so it would be best to maybe spend IDR50,000 first before you go bananas. Since we were full, we just bought some Banana Fritters with Srikaya and Ronde Jahe (some sort of traditional dumpling with ginger soup). <br><br>
<b>Farmhouse</b>, another spot in Lembang that our driver recommended. There is another entrance fee of IDR20,000 per person in exchange for selections of fresh milk (original, strawberry, and chocolate). I'm not a big fan of milk, but I tried all 3 and would definitely comeback for the strawberry flavor. Having ourselves overloaded with food and deserts beforehand, we were not able to finish up the milk. Anyhow, this location is another spot for people to take cute instagrammable pictures with different animals such as guinea pigs, birds, lizards, or goats. For another IDR20,000 per person, I think you can get in to "My Secret" which is known for its miniature houses that resembles hobbit houses. We did not get into it since it was almost closed and the sun has set. Maybe we�ll visit someday when we come back. We bought a huge cotton candy for IDR35,000 that was supposed to shape as hello kitty, but I think there were not get paid enough to make it real enough.
