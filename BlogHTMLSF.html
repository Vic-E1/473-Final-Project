Here we go, my first post, Eugene O'Neill NHS. Who is Eugene? He is the only American who managed to receive a Nobel Prize in Literature and 4 Pulitzer Prize in Drama. This basically means, he was an influential figure in shifting the history through his writings, scripts, and playwrights during 1920-1957. But let me save all of the historical sentimental for you to visit and ask the NPS staff. Let me start off by saying that this place is worth a visit for someone who admires vintage houses. What makes it special is that embeds Asian-Chinese furniture and art displays into a Spanish style home, they call it the pseudo-Chinese home.
<br><br>
<b>1.	Harmonious Garden</b><br>
Your visit should start off by looking at the old horse cartwheel, not sure what the significance is, but it might have been a method of transport for humans or goods at the time. Then you'll move on to the wooden door gate with a Tao inscription that means "The Way," where you, again, will take more pictures. As you enter the gate, you will go through a beautiful garden where you can take more pictures overlooking the house with colorful flowers around it.
<br><br>
<b>2.	The Tao House</b><br>
As you walk into the house, you will see a staircase where different Asian-inspired art bits were displayed on the wall and staircase. You might also notice that there is a green shaded mirror near the door. If I remember correctly, there were 3 colored mirrors in the house that you can find, green, blue, and black. All mirrors were meant to control the lighting inside of the house, helping with Carlotta's eye problems.
<br><br>
<b>3.	Eugene's Office</b><br>
Moving upstairs, passing Eugene's room and closet, you will find his office. The room was filled with books and ship miniatures. You can also find a sample of his writings on his actual desk. You will realize how small he wrote that you need a magnifying glass to read it easily. Never in my life had I squinted my eyes so hard trying to read something that is actually pretty legible. Over the green doors (which is off-limit), you can see a typewriter sitting on a desk. Carlotta helped Eugene transcribed his work from hand writing to being typed.
<br><br>
<b>4.	Carlotta's Room</b><br>
Going back passing the stairways, you will find Carlotta's room (I think the tour might lead you to this room first before Eugene's). In her room, you will see the original dog's bed, as well as photos taken in black and white showing Eugene, Carlotta, and Blemie. There is a small closet leading to an off limit restroom, there you can find a beautiful kimono and a Louis Vuitton luggage.
<br><br>
<b>5.	Visitor Center</b><br>
After going back down the stairs, you will walk pass a kitchen that has an old General Electric refrigerator (I thought it was interesting), a creepy servant's wing, onto the visitor center. Here, you will get a cancellation stamp "Danville." If you are into literature, make sure to grab some books about Eugene. Outside, you can make your way towards the swimming pool downstairs, or else, you can go back up to where the shuttle is.
<br><br>
<b>6.	Barn (Performance Venue)</b><br>
Darn it! I did not spent too much time on this since most people are already done with the tour, and the shuttle driver will wait for you to finish roaming. However, if you get the chance, go to the white barn across the house and see what's inside. From the outside, you can kind of see a wooden platform and chairs, but again, I'm not so sure. Maybe I'll come back one day just to cover this section.
<br><br>
<b>7.	Dalmatian Grave</b><br>
So, the last 15 minutes running around the property taking pictures while the other two visitors are already waiting for us in the van, I managed to visit Blemie's grave which is located just a few feet away from the Barn. There should be two unlocked gate that you can open and there you will see Blemie's tombstone. When I said there was a heartbreaking story behind the Tao House, it would be the death of their Dalmatian. In the visitor center, I managed to grab a poster sized script written by Eugene telling a story through Blemie's mind. If you read it, warning, eyes might get a little puffy.
